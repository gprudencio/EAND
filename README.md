The EAND algorithm code is presented for minimization and maximization problems, and for integer and non-integer variables. The algorithm is coded in MATLAB and Python and the equations were referenced according to the article.

A four-dimensional benchmark evaluation function is represented in the Function script. Other optimization functions can be replaced in this code. 

The main function initializes the simulation with default initial parameters such as number of simulations, population size, number of independent variables, and lower and upper limits. The algorithm is executed for a set number of simulations, and a statistical analysis is provided at the end of the execution.
