The EAND algorithm code has comments and the equations were referenced according to the article.

The evaluation function was represented in the Function script. In this example, the Sphere function was implemented as a four-dimensional optimization problem. 
Other optimization functions can be replaced in this code. 

The main function initializes the simulation. Here the initial parameters such as number of simulations, population size, number of independent variables, 
and lower and upper limits are updated by the user. A set of parameters was used as an example for the Sphere function.

The main function executes the EAND algorithm for a set number of simulations, and a statistical analysis is provided at the end of the execution.
